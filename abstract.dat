Biogenic sulfide (BS) in anaerobic digesters was previously suggested to mitigate the potential impacts of metallic nanoparticles (M-NPs) on antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) propagation by sulfidation of the M-NPs. In this study, a new role of BS in regulating ARGs responses to M-NPs is reported. It was observed that CuO NPs at environmentally relevant level had no significant effects on the spread of ARGs. However, higher dosage (50 mg/gTSS) contributed to the propagation of ARGs, whose abundances would be effectively reduced by 74-115% if BS production was stimulated. Instead, introduction of EDTA, a metal ion chelator, resulted in much lower attenuation efficiencies (12-40%), indicating that restriction of the bioavailability of CuO NPs might not be the only reason for the buffering of ARG responses in the presence of BS. Further investigation showed that the presence of BS together with activation of key enzymes (O-acetyl serine sulfhydrylase and γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase) supplied and favored the biosynthesis and transformation of cysteine, which mitigated the oxidative stress induced by CuO NPs. Moreover, the amounts of cysteine and its metabolite glutathione in sludge were associated with the abundances of ARGs negatively, implying that in situ generated cysteine was the important ARGs regulator. Exploration of possible mechanisms revealed that the biosynthesized cysteine might limit gene transfer potential via mobile genetic elements, as cysteine restricted the abundances of intI 1, Tn916/1545 and ISCR 1. In addition, the cysteine remarkably alleviated the copper stress and copper resistance, which in turn blocked possible co-selection between copper and antibiotic resistance. This work provides new insight into attenuation of the bio-effects of NPs in digesters.
In this study we report the design, construction and validation of a novel transposon aimed to systematically screen for protein localization and expression patterns in prokaryotes using fluorescence microscopy. Upon random insertion in an open reading frame in the proper frame and orientation, the transposon creates an N-terminal fluorescent protein fusion to the msfGFP reporter. Moreover, in order to examine the localization of fusion proteins whose native expression might be too low or absent, the transposon was fitted with a PLtetO-1 promoter that makes the expression of the generated fluorescent protein fusions controllable by anhydrotetracycline. Importantly, upon flipping out the PLtetO-1 promoter and neighboring antibiotic resistance marker, an in-frame "sandwich" msfGFP fusion is created in which the N- and C-terminal portions of the targeted protein are again controlled by its native promoter.
This study explores the prevalence, emission and reduction of five ARGs (sulI, tetA, mphB, qnrD and mcr-1) and integron (intI) through a distributed swine wastewater purification facility and the effluent-receiving environment. Typical metal resistance genes (MRGs), pathogenic bacterial indicators, the bacterial community and wastewater properties were also explored to determine their effects on the fates of ARGs. Results indicated that the purification process could hardly effectively remove ARGs' prevalence. 3.1×104 ~7.1×108 copies/L were present after purification, and 4~57% of them persisted in the subsequent creek and adjacent soil. 16S rRNA sequencing suggested that the discharge of wastewater significantly changed the bacterial community in receiving creek and soil. Molecular ecological networks analysis detected the wide co-occurrence among ARGs, MRGs and PBGs, which could further facilitate the propagation of antibiotic resistance. ARG incidence and specific bacterial genera were closely correlated, suggesting an extensive hosting relationship. Redundancy analyses showed wastewater organics and nutrients showed positive correlation to most ARGs' abundance, but negatively correlated to their relative abundance.

Antimicrobial resistance has emerged as a huge challenge to the effective treatment of infectious diseases. Aside from a modest number of novel anti-infective agents, very few new classes of antibiotics have been successfully developed for therapeutic use. Despite the research efforts of numerous scientists, the fight against antimicrobial (ATB) resistance has been a longstanding continued effort, as pathogens rapidly adapt and evolve through various strategies, to escape the action of ATBs. Among other mechanisms of resistance to antibiotics, the sophisticated envelopes surrounding microbes especially form a major barrier for almost all anti-infective agents. In addition, the mammalian cell membrane presents another obstacle to the ATBs that target intracellular pathogens. To negotiate these biological membranes, scientists have developed drug delivery systems to help drugs traverse the cell wall; these are called "Trojan horse" strategies. Within these delivery systems, ATB molecules can be conjugated with one of many different types of carriers. These carriers could include any of the following: siderophores, antimicrobial peptides, cell-penetrating peptides, antibodies, or even nanoparticles. In recent years, the Trojan horse-inspired delivery systems have been increasingly reported as efficient strategies to expand the arsenal of therapeutic solutions and/or reinforce the effectiveness of conventional ATBs against drug-resistant microbes, while also minimizing the side effects of these drugs. In this paper, we aim to review and report on the recent progress made in these newly prevalent ATB delivery strategies, within the current context of increasing ATB resistance.
The aim of the present study was to explore the therapeutic efficacy of microemulsion-based delivery of histidine-capped silver nanoparticles in eradicating Klebsiella pneumoniae-induced burn wound infection. The developed microemulsion was characterized on the basis of differential light scattering, phase separation, refractive index, and specific conductance. Emulgel was prepared and characterized on the basis of thixotropy, texture, differential scanning calorimetry, and release kinetics. Emulgel was further evaluated in skin irritation and in vivo studies, namely full-thickness K. pneumoniae-induced burn wound infection treatment via topical route. Efficacy of treatment was evaluated in terms of bacterial load, histopathology, wound contraction, and other infection markers. The developed emulgel provided significant in vivo antibacterial activity of histidine-capped silver nanoparticle preparations via topical route and resulted in reduction in bacterial load, wound contraction, and enhanced skin healing as well as decrement of inflammatory markers such as malondialdehyde, myeloperoxidase, and reactive nitrogen intermediate compared to untreated animals. The present study encourages the further employment of histidine-capped silver nanoparticles along with microemulsion-based drug delivery system in combating antibiotic-resistant topical infections.
Despite strengthened antimicrobial therapy, biofilm infections of Acinetobacter baumannii are associated with poor prognosis and limited therapeutic options. Assessing antibiotics on planktonic bacteria can result in failure against biofilm infections. Currently, antibiotics to treat biofilm infections are administered empirically, usually without considering the susceptibility of the biofilm objectively before beginning treatment. For effective therapy to resolve biofilm infections it is essential to assess the efficacy of commonly used antibiotics against biofilms. Here, we offer a robust and simple assay to assess the efficacy of antibiotics against biofilms. In the present work, we carefully optimized the incubation time, detection range, and fluorescence reading mode for resazurin-based viability staining of biofilms in 96-well-plates and determined minimal biofilm eradication concentrations (MBECs) for A. baumannii isolates from patients with chronic infection. By applying this assay, we demonstrated that antibiotic response patterns varied uniquely within the biofilm formation of various clinical samples. MBEC-50 and 75 have significant discriminatory power over minimum inhibitory concentrations for planktonic suspensions to differentiate the overall efficiency of an antibiotic to eradicate a biofilm. The present assay is an ideal platform on which to assess the efficacy of antibiotics against biofilms in vitro to pave the way for more effective therapy.
Paenibacillus larvae, causative agent of American Foulbrood (AFB), is the primary bacterial pathogen affecting honeybees and beekeeping. The main methods for controlling AFB are incineration of diseased colonies or prophylactic antibiotic treatment (e.g. tylosin), neither of which is fully satisfactory. The search for superior means for controlling AFB has led to an increased interest in the natural relationships between the honeybee pathogenic and mutualistic microorganisms, and in particular the antagonistic effects of honeybee-specific Lactic Acid Bacteria (hbs-LAB) against P. larvae These effects have only been demonstrated on individual larvae in controlled laboratory bioassays. Here we investigated whether supplemental administration of hbs-LAB had a similar beneficial effect on P. larvae infection at colony level. We compared experimentally AFB-infected colonies treated with hbs-LAB supplements to untreated and tylosin-treated colonies, recorded AFB symptoms, bacterial spore levels and two measures of colony health. To account for the complexity of a bee colony we focused on (Bayesian) probabilities and magnitudes of effect sizes. Tylosin reduced AFB disease symptoms but also had a negative effect on colony strength. The tylosin treatment did not, however, affect P. larvae spore levels, and might therefore "mask" the potential for disease. Hbs-LAB tended to reduce brood size in the short-term, but was unlikely to affect AFB symptoms or spores. These results do not contradict demonstrated antagonistic effects of hbs-LAB against P. larvae at the individual bee level, but rather suggest that supplementary administration of hbs-LAB may not be the most effective way to harness these beneficial effects at colony level.ImportanceThe previously demonstrated antagonistic effects of honeybee-derived bacterial microbiota on the infectivity and pathogenicity of P. larvae in laboratory bioassays has identified a possible new approach to AFB control. However, honeybee colonies are complex super-organisms where social immune defenses play a major role in resistance against disease at the colony-level. Few studies have investigated the effect of beneficial microorganisms on bee diseases at the colony level. Effects observed at the individual bee level do not necessarily translate into similar effects at the colony level. This study partially fills this gap by showing that, unlike at individual level, hbs-LAB supplements did not affect AFB symptoms at colony level. The inference is that the mechanisms regulating the honeybee microbial dynamics within a colony are too strong to manipulate positively through supplemental feeding of live hbs-LAB, and that new potential remedies identified through laboratory research have to be tested thoroughly in situ, in colonies.
Microbial ecosystems tightly associated with a eukaryotic host are wide-spread in nature. The genetic and metabolic networks of the eukaryotic hosts and the associated microbes have co-evolved to form a symbiotic relationship. Both the Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis and the Gram-negative Serratia plymuthica can form biofilms on plant roots, and thus can serve as a model system for the study of interspecies interactions in a host-associated ecosystem. We found that B. subtilis biofilms expand collectively and asymmetrically towards Serratia plymuthica, while expressing a non-ribosomal antibiotic bacillaene and an extracellular protease. As a result, B. subtilis biofilms out-competed S. plymuthica for a successful colonization of the host. Strikingly, the plant host could enhance the efficiency of this killing by inducing bacillaene synthesis. In turn, B. subtilis biofilms increased the resistance of the plant host to pathogens. These results provide an example of how plant-bacterium symbiosis promotes the immune response of the plant host and the fitness of the associated bacteria.Importance Our study sheds a mechanistic light on how multicellular biofilm units compete and successfully colonize a eukaryote host, using B. subtilis microbial communities as our lens. The microbiota and its interactions with its host play various roles in the development and prevention of diseases. Using competing beneficial biofilms that are essential microbiota members on the plant host, we found that B. subtilis biofilms activate collective migration to capture their prey followed by non-ribosomal antibiotic synthesis. Plant hosts increase the efficiency of antibiotic production by B. subtilis biofilms as they activate the synthesis of polyketides, therefore our study provides a first evidence to a mechanism by which the host can indirectly select for beneficial microbiota members.
Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines have reduced the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease, caused by vaccine serotypes, but non-vaccine-serotypes remain a concern. We used whole genome sequencing to study pneumococcal serotype, antibiotic resistance and invasiveness, in the context of genetic background.
Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) tops the list of threats to human health. Studies exploring predictors of mortality in patients with CRAB infection produced conflicting results.
Aim: This study investigated the susceptibility of Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli to curcumin, as well as its synergistic effect with 12 antimicrobial drugs. Methods and Results: Our study shows that curcumin did not affect bacterial growth. The antimicrobial susceptibility of curcumin and antibiotic synergy were identified using disc diffusion on Mueller-Hinton agar. The strain of Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli used was resistant to Ampicillin, Amoxicillin/Clavulanic acid, Ampicillin/Sulbactam, Ciprofloxacin, and Cefazolin. There was synergy between curcumin and the majority of antibiotics tested. Maximum synergy was observed with combinations of 330 µg/mL curcumin and Ceftazidime, followed by Cefotaxime, Amoxicillin/Clavulanic acid, Ampicillin, Aztreonam, Trimethoprim, Ciprofloxacin, Ceftriaxone, Cefazolin, Tetracycline, and Imipenem. Conclusion: Our findings indicated that curcumin might be useful as a combinatorial strategy to combat the antibiotic resistance of Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli.
Eggerthia catenaformis is a Gram-positive anaerobic rod, which has been rarely reported in human diseases. We report the second case of bacteremia due to this microorganism in an elderly patient. A 73-year-old man, without underlying diseases presented with fever, odynophagia and swelling of the cervical lymph node for several days. Culture of drained cervical fluid resulted in the isolation of Raoultella ornithinolytica and Streptococcus anginosus. Anaerobic blood cultures yielded a rare anaerobic microorganism, identified as Eggerthia catenaformis. No resistance to tested antimicrobials was documented. Treatment with drainage and several antibiotic regimens was established, and the general condition of the patient improved ,at two months of follow-up.
The incidence of cutaneous nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) infections is increasing. These infections are a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge.
Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most commonly reported infections in adult women and have high rates of recurrence, especially in postmenopausal women. Recurrent UTI (RUTI) greatly reduces quality of life, places a significant burden on the healthcare system, and contributes to antimicrobial resistance. Because treatment of RUTI by long-term antibiotic therapy is often ineffective or poorly tolerated in elderly women, new therapies must be developed. The molecular basis of RUTI, especially in postmenopausal women, has remained unclear because modeling RUTI in mice is difficult, and human data are limited. Invasion of the urothelium and induction of host inflammation are hypothesized to be key mechanisms by which bacterial pathogens cause RUTI. To further our understanding of RUTI in humans, we performed a systematic analysis of urine and bladder biopsy samples from postmenopausal women undergoing cystoscopy with fulguration of trigonitis (CFT) in the advanced management of antibiotic-refractory RUTI. We provide direct evidence that bacteria reside in the bladder wall of postmenopausal RUTI patients and that diverse bacterial species can be isolated from the bladder tissue. Histopathological scoring revealed significant edema and alterations of urothelial architecture in RUTI patient biopsies. Lymphocytes, including plasma B-cells, were detected within the mesenchyme, urothelium, and follicular aggregates in the majority of patients indicating that the local adaptive immune response is active during human RUTI. These data provide conclusive evidence that bacteria invade the human urothelium and suggest that diverse bacterial species and the adaptive immune response play important roles in RUTI in humans.
Lipid structure critically dictates the molecular interactions of drugs with membranes influencing passive diffusion, drug partitioning and accumulation, thereby underpinning a lipid-composition specific interplay. Spurring selective passive drug diffusion and uptake through membranes is an obvious solution to combat growing antibiotic resistance with minimized toxicities. However, the spectrum of complex mycobacterial lipids and lack thereof of suitable membrane platforms limits the understanding of mechanisms underlying drug-membrane interactions in tuberculosis. Herein, we developed membrane scaffolds specific to mycobacterial outer membrane and demonstrate them as improvised research platforms for investigating anti-tubercular drug interactions. Combined spectroscopy and microscopy results reveal an enhanced partitioning of model drug Rifabutin in trehalose dimycolate-containing mycobacterial membrane systems. These effects are apportioned to specific changes in membrane structure, order and fluidity leading to enhanced drug interaction. These findings on the membrane biophysical consequences of drug interactions will offer valuable insights for guiding the design of more effective antibiotic drugs coupled with tuned toxicity profiles.
The availability of antibiotics presents medical practitioners with a prescribing dilemma. On the one hand, antibiotics provide a safe and effective treatment option for patients with bacterial infections, but at a population level, over-prescription reduces their effectiveness by facilitating the evolution of bacteria that are resistant to antibiotic medication. A game-theoretic investigation, including analysis of equilibrium strategies, evolutionarily stability, and replicator dynamics, reveals that rational doctors, motivated to attain the best outcomes for their own patients, will prescribe antibiotics irrespective of the level of antibiotic resistance in the population and the behavior of other doctors, although they would achieve better long-term outcomes if their prescribing were more restrained. Ever-increasing antibiotic resistance may therefore be inevitable unless some means are found of modifying the payoffs of this potentially catastrophic social dilemma.
Here, we devised a new strategy for eradicating cancer stem cells (CSCs), via a "synthetic-metabolic" approach, involving two FDA-approved antibiotics and a dietary vitamin supplement. This approach was designed to induce a "rho-zero-like" phenotype in cancer cells. This strategy effectively results in the synergistic eradication of CSCs, using vanishingly small quantities of two antibiotics. The 2 metabolic targets are i) the large mitochondrial ribosome and ii) the small mitochondrial ribosome. Azithromycin inhibits the large mitochondrial ribosome as an off-target side-effect. In addition, Doxycycline inhibits the small mitochondrial ribosome as an off-target side-effect. Vitamin C acts as a mild pro-oxidant, which can produce free radicals and, as a consequence, induces mitochondrial biogenesis. Remarkably, treatment with a combination of Doxycycline (1 μM), Azithromycin (1 μM) plus Vitamin C (250 μM) very potently inhibited CSC propagation by >90%, using the MCF7 ER(+) breast cancer cell line as a model system. The strong inhibitory effects of this DAV triple combination therapy on mitochondrial oxygen consumption and ATP production were directly validated using metabolic flux analysis. Therefore, the induction of mitochondrial biogenesis due to mild oxidative stress, coupled with inhibition of mitochondrial protein translation, may be a new promising therapeutic anti-cancer strategy. Consistent with these assertions, Vitamin C is known to be highly concentrated within mitochondria, by a specific transporter, namely SVCT2, in a sodium-coupled manner. Also, the concentrations of antibiotics used here represent sub-antimicrobial levels of Doxycycline and Azithromycin, thereby avoiding the potential problems associated with antibiotic resistance. Finally, we also discuss possible implications for improving health-span and life-span, as Azithromycin is an anti-aging drug that behaves as a senolytic, which selectively kills and removes senescent fibroblasts.
In 2016, the World Health Organization deemed antibiotic resistance one of the biggest threats to global health, food security, and development. The need for new methods to combat infections caused by antibiotic resistant pathogens will require a variety of approaches to identifying effective new therapeutic strategies. One approach is the identification of small molecule adjuvants that potentiate the activity of antibiotics of demonstrated utility, whose efficacy is abated by resistance, both acquired and intrinsic. To this end, we have identified compounds that enhance the efficacy of antibiotics normally ineffective against Gram-negative pathogens because of the outer membrane permeability barrier. We identified two adjuvant compounds that dramatically enhance sensitivity of Acinetobacter baumannii to macrolide and glycopeptide antibiotics with reductions in minimal inhibitory growth concentrations as high as 256-fold, and activity observed across a variety of clinical isolates. Mode of action studies indicate that these adjuvants likely work by modulating lipopolysaccharide synthesis or assembly. The adjuvants were active in vivo in a Galleria mellonella infection model, indicating potential for use in mammalian infections.
One way to slow the spread of resistant bacteria is by improved stewardship of antibiotics: using them more carefully and reducing the number of prescriptions. With an estimated 7%-10% of antibiotic prescriptions globally originating from dental practices and up to 80% prescribed unnecessarily, dentistry has an important role to play. To support the design of new stewardship interventions through knowledge transfer between contexts, this study aimed to identify factors associated with the decision to prescribe antibiotics to adults presenting with acute conditions across primary care (including dentistry).
Rising rates of antimicrobial resistance are driven by overuse of antibiotics. Characterizing physician antibiotic prescribing variability can inform interventions to optimize antibiotic use.
Campylobacter is a leading cause of bacterial foodborne gastroenteritis worldwide, and poultry are a major source of human campylobacteriosis. The control of Campylobacter from farm to fork is challenging due to emergence of microbial resistance and lack of effective control methods. We identified a benzyl thiophene sulfonamide based small molecule (compound 1) with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 100 μM against Campylobacter jejuni 81-176 and Campylobacter coli ATCC33559, good drug-like properties, and low toxicity on eukaryotic cells. Compound 1 was used as a lead for the preparation of 13 analogues. Two analogues, compounds 4 and 8 (TH-4 and TH-8), were identified with better antimicrobial properties than compound 1. TH-4 and TH-8 had a MIC of 12.5 μM and 25 μM for C. coli and 50 μM and 100 μM for C. jejuni, respectively. Cytological studies revealed that both compounds affected C. jejuni envelope integrity. Further, both compounds had no effect on other foodborne pathogens. TH-4 and TH-8 had a minimal impact on the chicken cecal microbiota and were not toxic to colon epithelial cells and chicken macrophages, and red blood cells at 200 µM. Further, TH-4 and TH-8 reduced the Campylobacter load in chicken ceca (up to 2-log reduction) when infected chickens were orally treated for 5 days with 0.254 mg kg-1; as well as against internalized Campylobacter in Caco-2 cells at 12.5 µM and higher. Our study identified two novel specific and safe benzyl thiophene sulfonamide derivatives having potential for control of Campylobacter in chickens and humans.
There is an urgent need for new therapies to overcome antimicrobial resistance especially in Gram-negative bacilli (GNB). Repurposing old U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs as complementary agents to existing antibiotics in a synergistic combination presents an attractive strategy. Here, we demonstrate that the anthelmintic drug niclosamide selectively synergized with the lipopeptide antibiotic colistin against colistin-susceptible but more importantly against colistin-resistant GNB, including clinical isolates that harbor the mcr-1 gene. Breakpoints for colistin susceptibility in resistant Gram-negative bacilli were reached in the presence of 1 μg/ml (3 μM) niclosamide. Reversal of colistin resistance was also observed in combinations of niclosamide and polymyxin B. Enhanced bacterial killing was evident for the combination, in comparison to colistin monotherapy, against resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Enterobacter cloacae Accumulating evidence in the literature, along with our results, strongly suggests the potential for the combination of niclosamide and colistin to treat colistin-resistant Gram-negative bacillary infections. Our finding is significant since colistin is an antibiotic of last resort for multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections that are nonresponsive to conventional treatments. With the recent global dissemination of plasmid-encoded colistin resistance, the addition of niclosamide to colistin therapy may hold the key to overcome colistin resistance.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important pathogen associated with significant morbidity and mortality. U.S. guidelines for the treatment of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia recommend the use of two antipseudomonal drugs for high-risk patients to ensure that ≥95% of patients receive active empirical therapy. We evaluated the utility of combination antibiograms in identifying optimal anti-P. aeruginosa drug regimens. We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of the antimicrobial susceptibility of all nonduplicate P. aeruginosa blood and respiratory isolates collected between 1 October 2016 and 30 September 2017 from 304 U.S. hospitals in the BD Insights Research Database. Combination antibiograms were used to determine in vitro rates of susceptibility to potential anti-P. aeruginosa combination regimens consisting of a backbone antibiotic (an extended-spectrum cephalosporin, carbapenem, or piperacillin-tazobactam) plus an aminoglycoside or fluoroquinolone. Single-agent susceptibility rates for the 11,701 nonduplicate P. aeruginosa isolates ranged from 72.7% for fluoroquinolones to 85.0% for piperacillin-tazobactam. Susceptibility rates were higher for blood isolates than for respiratory isolates (P < 0.05). Antibiotic combinations resulted in increased susceptibility rates but did not achieve the goal of 95% antibiotic coverage. Adding an aminoglycoside resulted in higher susceptibility rates than adding a fluoroquinolone; piperacillin-tazobactam plus an aminoglycoside resulted in the highest susceptibility rate (93.3%). Intensive care unit (ICU) isolates generally had lower susceptibility rates than non-ICU isolates. Commonly used antipseudomonal drugs, either alone or in combination, did not achieve 95% coverage against U.S. hospital P. aeruginosa isolates, suggesting that new drugs are needed to attain this goal. Local institutional use of combination antibiograms has the potential to optimize empirical therapy of infections caused by difficult-to-treat pathogens.
We developed a rapid high-throughput PCR test and evaluated highly antibiotic-resistant clinical isolates of Escherichia coli (n = 2,919), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 1,974), Proteus mirabilis (n = 1,150), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1,484) for several antibiotic resistance genes for comparison with phenotypic resistance across penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems, aminoglycosides, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, fluoroquinolones, and macrolides. The isolates originated from hospitals in North America (34%), Europe (23%), Asia (13%), South America (12%), Africa (7%), or Oceania (1%) or were of unknown origin (9%). We developed statistical methods to predict phenotypic resistance from resistance genes for 49 antibiotic-organism combinations, including gentamicin, tobramycin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ertapenem, imipenem, cefazolin, cefepime, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, and aztreonam. Average positive predictive values for genotypic prediction of phenotypic resistance were 91% for E. coli, 93% for K. pneumoniae, 87% for P. mirabilis, and 92% for P. aeruginosa across the various antibiotics for this highly resistant cohort of bacterial isolates.
Staphylococcus aureus is a leading cause of infection in the United States, and due to the rapid development of resistance, new antibiotics are constantly needed. trans-Translation is a particularly promising antibiotic target because it is conserved in many bacterial species, is critical for bacterial survival, and is unique among prokaryotes. We have investigated the potential of KKL-40, a small-molecule inhibitor of trans-translation, and find that it inhibits both methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant strains of S. aureus KKL-40 is also effective against Gram-positive pathogens, including a vancomycin-resistant strain of Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, and Streptococcus pyogenes, although its performance with Gram-negative pathogens is mixed. KKL-40 synergistically interacts with the human antimicrobial peptide LL-37, a member of the cathelicidin family, to inhibit S. aureus but not other antibiotics tested, including daptomycin, kanamycin, or erythromycin. KKL-40 is not cytotoxic to HeLa cells at concentrations that are 100-fold higher than the effective MIC. We also find that S. aureus develops minimal resistance to KKL-40 even after multiday passage at sublethal concentrations. Therefore, trans-translation inhibitors could be a particularly promising drug target against S. aureus, not only because of their ability to inhibit bacterial growth but also because of their potential to simultaneously render S. aureus more susceptible to host antimicrobial peptides.
The nimbleness of Neisseria gonorrhoeae to evade the effect of antibiotics has perpetuated the fight against antibiotic-resistant gonorrhea for more than 80 years. The ability to develop resistance to antibiotics is attributable to its indiscriminate nature in accepting and integrating exogenous DNA into its genome. Here, we provide data demonstrating a novel combination of the 23S rRNA A2059G mutation with a mosaic-multiple transferable resistance (mosaic-mtr) locus haplotype in 14 N. gonorrhoeae isolates with high-level azithromycin MICs (≥256 μg/ml), a combination that may confer more fitness than in previously identified isolates with high-level azithromycin resistance. To our knowledge, this is the first description of N. gonorrhoeae strains harboring this novel combination of resistance determinants. These strains were isolated at two independent jurisdictions participating in the Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project (GISP) and in the Strengthening the U.S. Response to Resistant Gonorrhea (SURRG) project. The data suggest that the genome of N. gonorrhoeae continues to shuffle its genetic material. These findings further illuminate the genomic plasticity of N. gonorrhoeae, which allows this pathogen to develop mutations to escape the inhibitory effects of antibiotics.
Fruits are among the main natural sources of phenolic compounds (PC). These compounds exert important antioxidant properties primarily associated with the presence of hydroxyl groups in their molecular structure. Additionally, the antibacterial effects of fruit phenolic-rich extracts or individual PC commonly found in fruits have been an emerging research focus in recent years. This review discusses by first time the available literature regarding the inhibitory effects of fruit PC on pathogenic bacteria, including not only their direct effects on bacterial growth and survival, but also their effects on virulence factors and antibiotic resistance, as well as the possible mechanism underlying these inhibitory properties. The results of the retrieved studies show overall that the antibacterial effects of fruit PC vary with the target bacteria, type of PC and length of exposure to these compounds. The type of solvent and procedures used for extraction and fruit cultivar also seem to influence the antibacterial effects of phenolic-rich fruit extracts. Fruit PC have shown wide-spectrum antibacterial properties besides being effective antibiotic resistance modifying agents in pathogenic bacteria and these effects have shown to be associated with interruption of efflux pump expression/function. Furthermore, fruit PC can cause down regulation of a variety of genes associated with virulence features in pathogenic bacteria. Results of available studies indicate the depolarization and alteration of membrane fluidity as mechanisms underlying the inhibition of pathogenic bacteria by fruit PC. These data reveal fruit PC have potential antimicrobial properties, which should be rationally exploited in solutions to control pathogenic bacteria.
The genus Streptococcus comprises pathogens that strongly influence the health of humans and animals. Genome sequencing of multiple Streptococcus strains demonstrated high variability in gene content and order even in closely related strains of the same species and created a newly emerged object for genomic analysis, the pan-genome. Here we analysed the genome evolution of 25 strains of Streptococcus suis, 50 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and 28 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae.
The anaerobic process is a favorable alternative for the treatment of antibiotic pharmaceutical wastewater. The electrically assisted anaerobic process can be used to accelerate contaminant removal, especially for persistent organic pollutants such as antibiotics. In this study, an electrically assisted anaerobic system for chloramphenicol (CAP) wastewater treatment was developed. The system performance and the underlying metabolic mechanisms were evaluated under different applied voltages. With the increase of applied voltage from 0 to 2 V, the CAP removal efficiencies increased from 53.3% to 89.7%, while the methane production increased more than three times. The microbial community structure and correlation analysis showed that electrical stimulation selected the dominant functional bacteria and increased antibiotic resistance in dominant functional bacteria, both of which enhanced CAP removal and methane production. The improved CAP removal was a result of the presence of dechlorination-related bacteria (Acidovorax, Sedimentibacter, Thauera, and Flavobacterium) and potential electroactive bacteria (Shewanella and Comamonas), both of which carried ARGs and therefore could survive the biotoxicity of CAP. The enhanced methane production could be partly attributed to the surviving fermentative-related bacteria (Paludibacter, Proteiniclasticum, and Macellibacteroides) in the anaerobic bioreactor. The increased abundances of methanogenic genes (mcrA and ACAS genes) under high voltage further confirmed the enhanced methane production of this electrically assisted anaerobic system. The fundamental understanding of the mechanisms underlying metabolic performance enhancement is critical for the further development of anaerobic wastewater treatment.
Phytometabolism of antibiotics is a potentially significant route of human exposure to trace concentrations of antibiotics, prompting concerns about antibiotic resistance. The present study evaluated the metabolism of sulfamethoxazole (SMX), a commonly used sulfonamide antibiotic, by Arabidopsis thaliana. SMX was intensively metabolized by A. thaliana, with only 1.1% of SMX in plant tissues present as the parent compound after 10 days of exposure. Untargeted screening of extractable metabolites revealed that N-glycosylation was the main transformation pathway of SMX in A. thaliana plants, with N4-glycosyl-SMX accounting for more than 80% of the extractable metabolites. Additionally, N4-glycosyl-glycoside SMX accounted for up to 4.4% of the extractable metabolites, indicating glycosylation of N4-glycosyl-SMX. The majority of minor extractable SMX metabolites were also conjugates of the parent compound, such as pterin-SMX and methyl salicylate-SMX conjugates. In 14C-SMX trials, 14C-radioactivity was detected in both extractable and bound residues in plant tissues. Extractable residues, which included 14C-SMX and its soluble metabolites, accounted for 35.8-43.6% of the uptaken 14C-radioactivity, while bound residues were 56.4-64.2%. Approximately 27.0% of the initially applied 14C-radioactivity remained in the culture media at the conclusion of the experiments, composed of both 14C-SMX and its metabolites, likely due to plant excretion.
The aim of the study was to determine the comparative significance of basal metabolism indicators and inflammatory process markers for the closest prognosis of patients in ICUs with systemic inflammation syndrome caused with infectious genesis. The paper presents the results of a retrospective analysis of the plan of treatment of 198 patients with confirmed clinical and laboratory signs of bacterial infection. The number of leukocytes, platelets, the percentage of lymphocytes, the concentration of procalcitonin, creatinine, bilirubin, C-reactive protein, acid-base balance values were determined in patients. Patients were assessed on a SOFA scale. The type of biomaterial for microbiological research was determined depending on the intended source of infectious inflammation. Identification of the isolated microorganisms was carried out using the MALDI ToF mass spectrometry method, followed by determination of antibiotic resistance. Empirical antibiotic therapy was prescribed upon admission of the patient to the ICU. Patients were switched to etiotropic antibacterial therapy after 48 hours, taking into account the results of a microbiological study. Determination of basal metabolic rate was carried out using the method of indirect calorimetry (CCM Express, Medical Graphics) with the calculation of basal metabolism, respiratory coefficient, absolute and relative amount of macronutrients. The calculation of the protein was made on the basis of the nitrogen level of the daily urine urea. Logistic analysis (ROC analysis) revealed that the antibacterial therapy strategy used, age, gender of patients, tinctorial properties of microorganisms isolated from patients, do not affect the nearest prognosis of the disease. On the contrary, SOFA score, the concentration of procalcitonin in the blood, and such parameters of the metabolic status as the need for kilocalories per kilogram of actual body weight and the percentage of protein calories significantly affect the nearest prognosis of the disease. The percentage of calories derived from protein metabolism, in the main exchange has a high reliable predictive value. The results of the study confirm the importance of adequate nutritional therapy in the treatment of patients with infectious inflammatory syndrome, including the calculation and correction of protein loss and total daily calorie.
The prevalence of Helicobacter pylori resistance to levofloxacin and metronidazole was high in the Dominican Republic. We used two-fold agar dilution method to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration of five alternative antibiotics in 63 Dominican strains. We also assessed the genetic mutations associated with the antibiotic resistance using next-generation sequencing. We revealed that all 63 strains were sensitive towards sitafloxacin, furazolidone, and rifabutin. In contrast, the prevalence of rifaximin and garenoxacin resistance were high (82.5% and 34.9%, respectively). Patients more than or equal to 60 years old had the highest risk of double-antibiotic resistance (7/9, 77.8%, OR = 31.5, P = 0.009) and garenoxacin resistances (8/9, 88.9%, OR = 45.33, P = 0.002) with an increasing risk simultaneously by age (P = 0.004, r = 0.357). Almost all rifaximin resistant strains possessed multiple mutations with more than three mutations within rpoB including the most frequent novel mutations of S352L, I2726L, and V2465A. There was a significant association between vacA genotype and rifaximin resistance (P = 0.042). Among 23 levofloxacin-resistant strains, 82.6% (19/23, P <0.001) were also resistant to garenoxacin, and 39.1% (9/23) had a high minimal inhibitory concentration ≥8 μg/mL with positive trend correlation (P = <0.001, r = 0.84). Among 19 garenoxacin resistant strains, 16 (84.2%) contained mutations at D91 and N87 of gyrA. In conclusion, sitafloxacin, rifabutin, and furazolidone might be considered as alternative antibiotics to be included in H. pylori eradication regimen in regions with high prevalence of levofloxacin and metronidazole resistance, such as the Dominican Republic.
Antimicrobial drugs have an important role in controlling bacterial infectious diseases. However, the increasing resistance of bacteria to antibiotics has become a global health care problem. Rapid determination of antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical isolates is often crucial for the optimal antimicrobial therapy. The conventional methods used in medical centers for susceptibility testing are time-consuming (>2 days). Two bacterial culture steps are needed, the first is used to grow the bacteria from urine on agar plates to determine the species of the bacteria (~24 hours). The second culture is used to determine the susceptibility by growing colonies from the first culture for another 24 hours. Here, the main goal is to examine the potential of infrared microscopy combined with multivariate analysis, to reduce the time it takes to identify Escherichia coli susceptibility to antibiotics and to determine the optimum choice of antibiotic to which the bacteria will respond. E coli colonies of the first culture from patients with urinary tract infections (UTI) were examined for the bacterial susceptibility using Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR). Our results show that it is possible to determine the optimum choice of antibiotic with better than 89% sensitivity, in the time span of few minutes, following the first culture.
Mass drug administration (MDA) for trachoma control using azithromycin has generated concern for the development of resistant organisms. However, the contribution from azithromycin available in local pharmacies has not been studied. In Kilosa district, Tanzania, MDA stopped over 4 years ago, and this study sought to determine the availability of azithromycin in local pharmacies and correlate it with azithromycin resistance in children born after MDA. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 644 randomly selected hamlets in Kilosa district, in which the presence of a pharmacy and the availability of azithromycin and erythromycin were determined. In 30 randomly selected hamlets, a random sample of 60 children less than 5 years were tested for azithromycin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn) and Escherichia coli (Ec), from nasopharyngeal and rectal swabs, based on disk diffusion criteria. Only 26.6% of hamlets had a pharmacy. Azithromycin and erythromycin were available in 30.8% and 89.1% of pharmacies closest to the hamlets, respectively. In the 30 communities tested for resistance, the overall prevalence of azithromycin-resistant Spn isolates was 14%. Six of seven (87%) hamlets where azithromycin was available had resistant Spn, compared with 14 of 23 (61%) hamlets without availability. Similarly, six of seven (87%) hamlets where azithromycin was available had resistant Ec isolates compared with 21 of 23 (70%) hamlets without availability. However, the differences were not statistically significant (P = 0.46 and 0.49, respectively). The availability of azithromycin in pharmacies in the district was limited, and a strong correlation with azithromycin-resistant Spn or Ec was not observed.
Three hundred fifteen bacteriological samples were obtained from feces and both external and visceral cavity surfaces of carcasses of 105 healthy buffalo slaughtered in southwest of Iran. Confirmed Escherichia coli isolates were examined for antimicrobial resistance phenotypically and were screened for stx1, stx2, and eae genes and their subtypes and assessment of antimicrobial resistance genes by regular PCR and RFLP techniques. One hundred forty-five E. coli were isolated from feces (96 isolates) and external (37) and internal (12) surfaces of carcasses. Results showed that the prevalence of STEC, EPEC, and EHEC pathotypes was 2.8%, 0.7%, and 0.7% respectively. Among 6 (4.13%) positive isolates for examined genes, 4 (2.8%) isolates were positive for stx1, 3 (2.1%) for stx2, and 2 (1.4%) for eae gene. The detected genes were classified into stx1a (4 isolates), stx2a, stx2b, stx2c, eae-β, and unknown subtypes. The most prevalent antibiotic resistance gene was sulII (11.03%). The tetB, qnrB, floR, blaTEM, blaSHV, and aadA genes were found to a lesser extent, and all isolates were negative for blaCTX-15, blaOXA, aac(3)-I, tetA, cat1, qnrA, sulI, dhfrI, and dhfrV genes. Twelve combination patterns of antibiotic-resistant genes were observed. Maximum phenotypically resistance rate was against doxycycline (91.83%), and the minimum was against ceftazidime and florfenicol (2.75%). E. coli isolates from feces and carcasses of slaughtered buffalo can be considered a mild reservoir for stx and eae genes. However, healthy buffaloes could be considered a potential reservoir of multiple antibiotic resistance genes in E. coli isolates.
This study was set to determine the genetic linkage and the clonal relationship between VRE faecium isolates in three hospitals of Ahwaz city. In this study, 1050 samples were collected from various rectal swabs, hands of health care workers (HCW), environmental surfaces, medical equipment, and 146 enterococci isolates from clinical sources of three hospitals from March to September 2015. Antimicrobial resistance patterns in VRE faecium were detected by disk diffusion method. Genetic linkages of VRE faecium strains were investigated by pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) methods. Out of 366 enterococcal isolates, 163 E. faecium isolates were found to be resistant to vancomycin. PFGE and MLST analysis showed the presence of 79 pulsotypes and 11 sequence types (ST), respectively. In total, 90% of the isolates belonged to CC17. Three new sequence types were reported for the first time in this study and ST80 was the predominant sequence type. We found a high prevalence of diverse VRE faecium with threatening antibiotic resistance patterns in all the studied sources with the dominance of CC17 VRE faecium strains in Ahwaz hospitals. Also, the results of typing method showed inter- and intra-hospital circulation of VRE faecium and similar pulsotypes and sequence types among different sources.
The rise in antibiotic resistance among bacterial pathogens has prompted the exploitation of alternative antibacterial strategies, such as antivirulence therapy. By inhibiting virulence traits, antivirulence drugs are expected to lessen pathogenicity without affecting bacterial growth, therefore avoiding the spread of resistance. However, some studies argued against this assumption, and the lack of antivirulence drugs in clinical use hampers the empirical assessment of this concept. Here we compared the mode of action and range of activity of two drugs which have been proposed for repurposing as quorum sensing and pyoverdine inhibitors in the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa: the anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and the antimycotic drug 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC), respectively. The effect on bacterial growth, emergence and spread of resistance, and activity against clinical isolates were assessed. Our results confirm that 5-FU has growth inhibitory activity on reference strains and can rapidly select for spontaneous resistant mutants with loss-of-function mutations in the upp gene, responsible for uracil conversion into UMP. These mutants were also insensitive to the anti-pyoverdine effect of 5-FC. Conversely, 5-FC did not cause relevant growth inhibition, likely because of poor enzymatic conversion into 5-FU by cytosine deaminase. However, coculturing experiments showed that 5-FU resistant mutants can outcompete sensitive cells in mixed populations, in the presence of not only 5-FU but also 5-FC. Moreover, we observed that serial passages of wild-type cells in 5-FC-containing medium leads to the appearance and spread of 5-FC insensitive sub-populations of 5-FU resistant cells. The different effect on growth of 5-FU and 5-FC was overall conserved in a large collection of cystic fibrosis (CF) isolates, corresponding to different infection stages and antibiotic resistance profiles, although high variability was observed among strains. Notably, this analysis also revealed a significant number of pyoverdine-deficient isolates, whose proportion apparently increases over the course of the CF infection. This study demonstrates that the efficacy of an antivirulence drug with no apparent effect on growth can be significantly influenced by the emergence of insensitive mutants, and highlights the importance of the assessment of resistance-associated fitness cost and activity on clinical isolates for the development of "resistance-proof" antivirulence drugs.
Tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis), remains as one of the leading causes of deaths worldwide, with nearly two million death cases annually. BCG (Bacille Calmette-Guerin) continues to be the most widely used vaccine in the world, but the protective immunity differs in different parts of the world. Accordingly, new strategies including DNA vaccines are essentially needed. This study was aimed to design and construct a cloning vector containing mpt64 gene of M. tuberculosis.
Antimicrobial stewardship program is a comprehensive, longitudinal program designed to improve and measure the appropriateness of antimicrobial use while increasing patients' safety, decreasing cost of patients' care, and combating emerging antimicrobial resistance. Antimicrobial resistance, specially emerging multidrug-resistance and extremely drug-resistance gram negative bacteria, is an important concern in the modern world. This is particularly problematic since antimicrobials in production pipelines are not meeting the demand for the emerging resistance micro-organisms; in another word "we are running out of options". Indiscriminate use of antimicrobial may increase the risk for resistance, and drug toxicity. The aim of this study is to implement an evidence-based antimicrobial stewardship program in a tertiary referral hospital. This study will assure consistency of the stewardship program and measure outcomes to further assess the effectiveness of this program.
The aim of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate the knowledge and attitudes concerning antibiotic use and resistance among members of the local community in Pulau Pinang, Malaysia. The study was conducted among 326 residents of the Jelutong district, Pulau Pinang state, from August to October 2013. A self-administered five-part questionnaire was used for the data collection. The respondents exhibited inadequate knowledge of antibiotics in general. Approximately 80% of them did not know the indications for antibiotic use, while 76% believed that antibiotics were useful in terms of resolving viral fever. Additionally, 52.6% believed that antibiotics could be used to treat all types of infections. Inadequate knowledge of antibiotic resistance was also evident among the respondents, since 72.9% of them did not agree that resistant bacteria can spread from human or animal to human, while 32% were unaware that bacteria can develop resistance to antibiotics. More than 60% of respondents admitted that they took antibiotics in order to accelerate their recovery from illness, while 34.8% claimed that they only stopped taking antibiotics when they felt better. The findings hence indicate that most respondents had poor knowledge and attitudes concerning antibiotic use and resistance, which suggests the need for more community-based educational campaigns designed to improve the public's knowledge and attitudes regarding antibiotics.
