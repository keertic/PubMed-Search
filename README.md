The main function of this project is to provide users with the ability to query a scientific database with a keyword and get resulting a histogram with terms that appear with the most frequency in relation with the query. The database in question is the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) PubMed database which is a database filled with research articles from various field, such as biology, medicine, chemistry, etc.. This functionality can allow for users to find relations between keywords and terms that would otherwise go unnoticed. An example would be to search with the term “antibiotics resistance” and analyze the resulting histogram to see if there are specific terms like names of antibiotics or types of bacteria that come up frequently. This tool can be used by researchers, students, and medical professionals to provide an avenue of research into topic relations in the a field of interest.
